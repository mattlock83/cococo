cococo is a command line tool to convert Xcode 11's code coverage data to [SonarQube's generic code coverage format](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/generic-test/). It is written in Swift and makes use of multiple threads to speed up the computation. 

## Usage
```
USAGE: cococo <xcresult> [-e <excluded-file-extension1> ...]

OPTIONS:
  --excluded, -e        Multiple file extensions which are excluded from processing
  --ignoredPaths, -i    Multiple file paths which are excluded from processing
  --legacy, -l          Work with xccoverage files used by Xcode 11.3 and below
  --help                Display available options
```

## Example
Run the tool for a given `xcresult` archive, exclude `.h` and `.m` files from processing and save the result to `sonarqube-generic-coverage.xml`.
```
cococo myproject.xcresult --excluded .h .m --ignoredPaths DerivedData/SourcePackages/checkouts > sonarqube-generic-coverage.xml
```

The Xcode 11's `xcresult` archive can be found in the derived data folder:
```
DerivedData/YourProject/Logs/Test/*.xcresult
```
